# IEEE_SmartCar
IEEE ComSoc Chapter competition, "Modifier 8.0 Embedded Systems"! 🏆🚗 a car that moves using a remote control and incorporate features to make it smarter and capable of performing specific tasks.
Here are some key highlights of our project:
Normal Mode: Standard remote control operation.
Auto Pilot Mode: Autonomous navigation using IR sensors.
Highway Mode: Maintains lane position, automatically switching lanes when detecting a car in front using ultrasonic sensors.
Technology: Powered by the ATmega32 microcontroller and controlled via a Bluetooth module.
